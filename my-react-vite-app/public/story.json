He invited you out to get food with a group of guys that you've never met at an italian place in Bristol. Then after that, go to some arcade bar you both have never heard of before. You honestly do not feel like going out whatsoever. Your perfect idea of Saturday night chilling on the sofa with a large box of Domino's pepperoni pizza, watching Breaking Bad for the third time. But Will trusts this group, he says they are chill. And you trust Will. Plus this outing will be good for Draymond’s social life, and getting to know the UK. He and his family have just moved from Compton California, and it has not been easy. Especially because he was raised in such a dangerous neighbourhood and lived that gang-banging life for so long, even though he’s only a year older than yourself. (You’re 17 by the the way). As you’re going through your closet, you’re not sure what to wear. It’s fall, and you wanna pick a pretty warm outfit.

You can tell she’s dying to. Then her parents will probably not question her as much. You can instantly relate. You have African parents. You tell her about your move from Africa recently and how you’ve struggled to make new friends, but are getting there slowly. You think you’re doing a pretty decent job of talking to this girl. However, it doesn’t take Draymond long to whisper in your ear when April isn’t looking and say: “You need to work on your game bro”. “Shut up.” you whisper back.

You look down to see a trail of blood, and it leads straight to Draymond. Even though you’re in intense pain yourself, you use your last strength to drag yourself over to Draymond’s body. Our group runs up to you both, and they start asking you if you’re okay. “I’m fine!” you yell out. Even speaking hurts at this point. Will tells you that the police and an ambulance have already been called. Another member of the group checks for Draymond’s pulse and fortunately, he still has one, but just barely. The rest of us can only stare at him in pity, hoping that it’s not the end. “Stay with me man!” you scream. Screaming again hurts both physically and emotionally. It surely can’t end like this. Then you hear the loud sound of blaring sirens and before you know it paramedics are rushing towards your group. They came with 2 ambulances. The police also arrive on the scene, and they start clearing out the rest of the people from the area and marking it a crime scene. They lift Draymond onto a stretcher and take him into an ambulance. Then they come for you and do the same, and they get you into another ambulance. Guess who else comes into the ambulance with you? April.",

Your parents come back in and as predicted, they start asking questions about what really and you tell them everything. They are really disappointed, and your mom says: “We’ll discuss your punishment later”. But they are proud of you for standing up to Liam.

In a nutshell, you both were rushed to the hospital by an ambulance. The doctors say that you have less severe injuries than Draymond and will be dismissed about 3 days from now. But you are so not concerned about yourself right now. “Is he gonna wake up?” you ask, fear and dread washing all over you. The doctors aren’t sure. This news makes you devastated, and you literally just pray that you didn’t just lose your best friend like this. They also explain that the police did an investigation and were able to watch most of what happened by means of street cameras. You guys both have to appear in court because you know, a fight broke out in the middle of the street at night. However, you’re hopeful that the judge will rule in you guys’ favour and those drunk scumbags will get the punishment that they deserve. Your parents are obviously not that happy about the court situation but for now, they are happy that you’re just alive. (They’ll sooooo deal with you later though). The terrible news of Draymond leaves a dead silence in the room. Everyone is absolutely overwhelmed with emotion, wondering if everything is going to be okay. It’s such a sad situation. All you can do is cry into your mom’s arms. You hope this isn’t the end.",

The hospital had allowed you to bring in your PS5 so that you and Draymond can play FIFA. You guys have been at it for hours ever since Draymond woke up. You are still thanking God that he made it out alive. It’s not all amazing though, you guys have got legal issues to deal with, as you were involved in a huge fight in public. You’ve got a court date and everything. But you’re hopeful that the judge will rule in your favour. And those scumbags will hopefully get the punishment they deserve. You guys then start the next game. Determined not to be subjected to another round of Draymond’s scornful remarks, and you are playing with your life. Super focused, calculating every movement you make with the ball on the screen. Then you hear the doctor call out your name. And you’re a little pissed off because he distracted your focus, and you were sure that you were winning. The doctor calls you aside and asks if you of a blond girl named Maya whose at the reception, asking to see Draymond. You know exactly who she is. “What’s going on bro?” Draymond asks. “Someone’s here to see you” you say with a smile, knowing that this could be a great start to his stay in the UK.",
