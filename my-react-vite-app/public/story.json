            "storyText": "“This is going to be sick bro!” your good friend Draymond says as you guys get ready. He’ll be at yours by 8:30 pm. You both were invited out to meet a group of friends by your mate William, who you call Will. But the catch is, he doesn’t even know exactly where you guys will be going. He says the group is going to a restaurant and then some arcade bar you’ve never heard of. You honestly do not feel like going out whatsoever. Your perfect idea of Saturday night chilling on the sofa with a large box of Domino's pepperoni pizza, watching Breaking Bad for the third time. But Will trusts this group, he says they are chill. And you trust Will. Plus this outing will be good for Draymond’s social life, and getting to know the UK. He and his family have just moved from Compton California, and it has not been easy. Especially because he was raised in such a dangerous neighbourhood and lived that gang-banging life for so long, even though he’s only a year older than yourself. (You’re 17 by the the way). As you’re going through your closet, you’re not sure what to wear. It’s fall, and you wanna pick a pretty warm outfit. You’re not looking to impress anyone in particular, but it is a group of new people and first impressions do matter. How do you dress?",

All the guys tell you their names, but you know that you won’t remember an hour from now, because you have the memory of an 87-year-old at 17. But then you ask the girl her name. Now you really start to notice her. She’s a little short, blonde girl with a Bristolian accent. You find her, pretty… cute. Hi “April,” she says in a smallish voice, which you find a little even more cute. “Nice to meet you April” you say as you exchange an awkward handshake. ",

You guys just make your way through the city centre. You and April start to chat a bit, and she’s quite nice to talk to and listen to. Before you know it, you two are opening up to each other. However, you are honestly such a shy person and you stutter a little bit as you talk to this girl. But she’s quite shy too. But you guys have a great conversation. She goes on about how she loves her parents, but they can be a little annoying sometimes and she often has to hide things from them. “I ‘m turning 18 in a week and I can’t wait!” she says. You can tell she’s dying too. Then her parents will probably not question her as much. You can instantly relate. You have African parents. You tell her about your move from Africa recently and how you’ve struggled to make new friends, but are getting there slowly. You think you’re doing a pretty decent job of talking to this girl. However, it doesn’t take Draymond long to whisper in your ear when April isn’t looking and say: “You need to work on your game bro”. “Shut up.” you whisper back. Draymond is good at talking to people though. He started a conversation with all 3 guys in the group just like that. You can only wish for bro’s confidence and charisma.

You all know what means. 18-year-olds and above only are allowed in. And these bouncers **do not** look friendly. This immediately makes you super uneasy. Draymond is 18 **AND** looks intimidating. He can get in, no problem. April is a pretty girl who just has to smile and literally walk past the bouncers to get in. (Pretty girl privilege innit?🙄)\n\nYou wonder how **you’ll** get in. Do you remember what Draymond told you that worked for him back in California? He didn’t make eye contact, kept his face down and just walked in. Bro was getting into clubs at 15! (Crazy work). You feel like that may work for you, but then the anxious thoughts come into your head. What if they ask for your age? Do you lie? What if you get caught? What if you go to jail? What if the world ends? Your string of anxious thoughts is broken by Will. “I’m sorry man” he says in an apologetic tone. “I didn’t know there’s an age limit here. If I had known…” “It’s fine, I’ll try to get in,” you say, interrupting. Will then replies: “You sure mate? That’s really risky. Be careful”. “I’ll be fine,” you say, but you’re honestly not convinced at all. “We’ll be right behind you brother” Draymond says to you assuringly. You stand there thinking for a second, and while the rest of the group goes in (including April, with ease 🙄). “You guys alright?” one of the guys says, turning back. “Yeah we’ll be just a second” Will says. “You doing this or not mate?” he asks, actually waiting for you to make a decision.
