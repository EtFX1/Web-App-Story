He invited you out to get food with a group of guys that you've never met at an italian place in Bristol. Then after that, go to some arcade bar you both have never heard of before. You honestly do not feel like going out whatsoever. Your perfect idea of Saturday night chilling on the sofa with a large box of Domino's pepperoni pizza, watching Breaking Bad for the third time. But Will trusts this group, he says they are chill. And you trust Will. Plus this outing will be good for Draymond’s social life, and getting to know the UK. He and his family have just moved from Compton California, and it has not been easy. Especially because he was raised in such a dangerous neighbourhood and lived that gang-banging life for so long, even though he’s only a year older than yourself. (You’re 17 by the the way). As you’re going through your closet, you’re not sure what to wear. It’s fall, and you wanna pick a pretty warm outfit.

You can tell she’s dying too. Then her parents will probably not question her as much. You can instantly relate. You have African parents. You tell her about your move from Africa recently and how you’ve struggled to make new friends, but are getting there slowly. You think you’re doing a pretty decent job of talking to this girl. However, it doesn’t take Draymond long to whisper in your ear when April isn’t looking and say: “You need to work on your game bro”. “Shut up.” you whisper back.

You look down to see a trail of blood, and it leads straight to Draymond. Even though you’re in intense pain yourself, you use your last strength to drag yourself over to Draymond’s body. Our group runs up to you both, and they start asking you if you’re okay. “I’m fine!” you yell out. Even speaking hurts at this point. Will tells you that the police and an ambulance have already been called. Another member of the group checks for Draymond’s pulse and fortunately, he still has one, but just barely. The rest of us can only stare at him in pity, hoping that it’s not the end. “Stay with me man!” you scream. Screaming again hurts both physically and emotionally. It surely can’t end like this. Then you hear the loud sound of blaring sirens and before you know it paramedics are rushing towards your group. They came with 2 ambulances. The police also arrive on the scene, and they start clearing out the rest of the people from the area and marking it a crime scene. They lift Draymond onto a stretcher and take him into an ambulance. Then they come for you and do the same, and they get you into another ambulance. Guess who else comes into the ambulance with you? April.",

You kept asking them about Draymond, but they weren’t sure as he was in the other ambulance. This creates an unexplainable feeling of anxiety in you. All you can do is wait. Fortunately, you’ve got April there with you. You guys talk for a bit in the ambulance, and you just break down and start to tell her everything. How old you are, how you felt coming about out in the first place, about how scared you were confronting the guy who spiked the drink. As you guys talk, you fall for her more and more. Then, you eventually gather the courage to ask her a question that’s been nagging at you for a while. “Why did you choose to ride with me?” you say. She gets all shy again but then gives you an answer. “I don’t know. I… just wanted to. I mean it’s not every day that a guy you meet saves your life”. You guys are looking into each other eyes again, but this time your faces are closer. At that very moment, the ambulance pulls up to the hospital.",

Draymond is just a little further ahead of you, as his ambulance had arrived at the hospital a bit sooner. You are met by your parents, April’s parents, and the rest of the group. Will had told them all the story. You are relieved to see your parents though you know that you’ll be in big trouble. As you’re being taken out of the ambulance into the hospital bed, you are in physical pain but you have an immense feeling of satisfaction because you were brave enough to stand up for the right thing. It’s an amazing feeling. And let’s be honest, you getting in a fight at 17 in an 18+ club is a story for your great-grandkids to hear.  And with the way things were going with you and April, it might be the start of something exciting in your life. But you’re still a liar, and that feeling of guilt won’t stop nagging your conscience. So it’s not all great right now. And of course, you are still in incredible anxiety over what happened to Draymond, but all you can do is wish for the best. And of course wish for that scumbag Liam to be put in jail, Where predators like him belong. ",

Please?” They look at each other. At this point, they’ll probably do anything for you because they thought they’d just lost their son not that long ago. Your parents leave, and it’s you and April, enclosed by the large curtain. She explains that her parents wanted to home, but she begs them to go inside the hospital just for a bit, trying to hide the details of why. In her words, she was given an “unconvinced yes”. (Basically, they’ll pester her with questions later). They didn’t give her long. Can’t blame them, they’d been through quite a lot. She managed to make you smile even though you had just received the worst news of your life. “I just wanted to say thank you again for saving me.” By the way, how’s Draymond?” You tell her the sad news and she bursts into tears again. “I’m such an idiot! This is my fault!” she says crying her heart out. “No April, it’s okay, it could happen to anyone” you say in a reassuring tone. Even though it hurts like hell, you raise your hand to wipe off the tears from her face. At this point, you guys are lost in each other’s eyes again. Your heart is beating out of its chest, and you both can feel the tension. Thoughts are flashing through your head at the speed of lightning. “Why do I feel this?” “I just met her” “But it feels like I’ve known her forever” Without even fully realising it, you move a strand of her pretty blonde hair behind her ear, and she turns bright red. She then moves closer to you until your lips are inches apart. Will this be your first kiss? What do you think?",

And she leaves. You are left there smiling so hard that anyone who sees you would wonder if you’re really in pain, in a hospital bed. Your parents come back in and as predicted, they start asking questions about what really and you tell them everything. They are really disappointed, and your mom says: “We’ll discuss your punishment later”. But they are proud of you for standing up to Liam. You guys talk for a bit more until your body finally shuts down for some much-deserved rest, and it all goes black. ",

You’ll never forget the feeling the feeling of unexplainable joy after the doctors told you that Draymond had woken up. Those 48 hours of waiting were awful. You also can’t forget how nervous you were asking April out on the first date, and the relief and joy you felt when she said yes! That day was the most you’ve ever enjoyed yourself inside of Wagamamas. (her suggestion btw). And of course, you can’t forget your first kiss! A night to remember. It wasn’t all positive. You guys did have to show up in court a few days for a trial because, well you fought in a bar. Oh, and you still have some community service left to do because you did lie about your age to get into the club. Fortunately, police got tested parts of the drink (god knows how they recovered it) and they found traces of Rohypnol (or Roofie). Long story short, he’s gonna be gone for a while. He’s sitting in jail as you speak. You’ve learned so much from the experience about bravery, quick thinking, sacrifice, but most importantly… don’t lie to get into a club dude. It’s not worth it.",
